# Database-System-course-s-project
Contains my database management system course's project
There are two projects. One contains a website where people can report cybercrime. Users will report, and the admin will assign it to an officer to deal with it.
The other one is about the blood bank management system. Whenever someone is in need of blood, they can take blood for free, but there is a cost issue that is for blood cross-matching. This system requires active participation from those people who are willing to donate blood. Without donating, there wonâ€™t be any blood in store, which can be given when someone is in need. Whenever an order is placed by a hospital, blood is reached there within a short time.
